# Arduino-Based-Password-Protected-Security-System
This project is an Arduino-based security system that uses a password entered via a keypad to control access to a physical space (e.g., a door lock or gate). Upon entering the correct password, the system responds with a green coloured led light for correct observation.But, incorrect passwords trigger a buzzer or alert by activating a red led light in itself.

Features
Password protection implemented via a keypad interface.

Two Led lights in the Breadboard

Simple password change functionality via keypad.

Easy customization, suitable for home, office, or personal security.

Hardware Requirements
Arduino board (e.g., Uno, Nano)

4x4 membrane keypad

LCD display (e.g., JHD1602A)

Servo motor for lock actuation

Buzzer for invalid password alerts

Breadboard and jumper wires

5V power supply

Software Setup
Install the Arduino IDE.

Download or clone the repository.

Install the required Arduino libraries: Keypad (for input), LiquidCrystal (for LCD), and optionally any motor control library.

Connect components as shown in the circuit diagram provided.

Upload the code to the Arduino.

Use the serial monitor for debug output and system messages.

Usage Instructions
Power up the Arduino system.

Enter the default password using the keypad (modifiable in the code).

On correct entry, the green LED starts to light up with a positive message; on incorrect entry, the red LED starts to light up and the buzzer beeps.

To change the password, use a designated key (e.g., ‘#’), then follow the on-screen instructions to update the password.

Customization
Change the default password in the code file.

Modify the password length or complexity as needed.

Add additional security features (e.g., fingerprint sensor, GSM alerts, internet connectivity) for expanded use cases.

Adjust feedback messages, servo timing, or alarm conditions in the code for tailored requirements.
